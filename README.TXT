WHAT IS IT
==========

This is yet another library for dynamic data generation using template.

This will allow you to separate code and data, letting non-programmer
to control final result (such as HTML) as desired without tweaking the
source.

Since you can embed real Perl script in template, there'll be no need
for you to learn another embedded language (like PHP/FI).

HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Just type:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

and you should be all set.

HOW TO USE
==========

For the usage, please consult POD document embedded in the library.
Also,

    perldoc Text::SimpleTemplate

should show you the document if installed correctly.
